# DOM: Document Object Model

# The DOM is used to connect webpages to scripts like JavaScript

# For each HTML box, there is an object in the DOM that we can access and interact with.

NOTA BENE: JS and DOM are two diffrent things

RECAP: METHOD is a function attached to some object

In this case that OBJECT is a document object, AND this object gives the access to the DOM.


!!!!!!!
html webpage content is stored in DOM, which can then be accessed and manipulated by the JS.

HTML and CSS crash course

HTML element can have ATRIBUTES:

<div class="..." id="...">Player 1</div>
this is a class atribute "class" and id atribute "id". There are lots of diferent atributes.


class atribute alloves us to give to the certain element a name.

id alloves also to give a name (??), but the diference is that id has to be unique. Class name can be used over and over again.

HTML is always divided into two parts:

1. the header
and 2. the body


The body contains the visible content of webpage. 

The header contains additional information about the webpage.
As well in header we can e.g. import in our code a custom font from google fonts.
As well in heder we connect html file and css style sheet.



In css we write RULES to style our webpage.


In the way we connect the HTML with CSS is by (usually) using class names:

eg.:

.player-name {
    font-size: 40px;
    text-align: center;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    letter-spacing: 2px;
    font-weight: 100;
    margin-top: 20px;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    position: relative;
}

we as well can use id or other selectors, but the most common one is the class selector.


So the rule ".player-name" styles all the elements that has the class "player-name".


//////////////////////
/////////////////////

eg.

body {
    background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(62, 20, 20, 0.4), rgba(62, 20, 20, 0.4)), url(back.jpg);
    background-size: cover;
    background-position: center;
    font-family: Lato;
    font-weight: 300;
    position: relative;
    height: 100vh;
    color: #555;
}

<-- this is a TYPE selector, because it selects all the elements with a type of "body". I.E. it selects the Body of our webpage.



/////////////////
////////////////
We have UNIVERSAL selector which selects all of the elements of the webpage:

* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    
}

// Besides exe#ution sta#k we have 'message queue' in JS engine
//this is where the events, that happen in the browser are put. And they sit there waiting to be pr##essed.
